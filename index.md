Welcome to the Polarization in Comparative Attitudes Project (PolarCAP)! This site describes the R package ```PolarCAP```---the main portal to PolarCAP data---and provides access to data files in a variety of formats for users not familiar with R. The short vignettes below explain how to retrieve data using ```PolarCAP``` and the links above provide access to function reference manuals, a record of changes to the package, downloadable data files, and the R package ```CPC```, which was used to generate the final PolarCAP estimates. For detailed information on the estimation of PolarCAP data, please see the book manuscript cited at the bottom of this page.

## Installation

There are two ways to easily install this package in R. To install the stable version released to CRAN, install as normal:
  
```
install.packages("PolarCAP")
library(PolarCAP)
```

To install the most recent development version, first ensure you have the latest version of ```devtools``` installed:
  
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Then, run the following code:
  
```
devtools::install_github("imehlhaff/PolarCAP")
```

## Usage

Most users of this package will be primarily interested in using it to easily retrieve polarization estimates for a defined set of countries and years. For example, let us take the countries and years generated by the following:
  
```
countries <- rep(c("AUS", "MEX", "USA"), each = 2)
years <- rep(c(2018, 2019), 3)
data <- as.data.frame(cbind(countries, years))
```

### Retrieve Data Frame

One way to retrieve polarization estimates for the countries and years generated above is to pass the vectors of countries and years to ```get.PolarCAP()``` or ```melt.PolarCAP()```, which return wide and tidy data frames, respectively:
  
```
get.PolarCAP(countries = countries, years = years, type = c("ideology", "affect"))
melt.PolarCAP(countries = countries, years = years, type = c("ideology", "affect"))
```

Standard errors of polarization estimates can be retrieved by adding the optional ```include.se``` argument, which defaults to ```FALSE```:
  
```
get.PolarCAP(countries = countries, years = years, type = c("ideology", "affect"), include.se = TRUE)
melt.PolarCAP(countries = countries, years = years, type = c("ideology", "affect"), include.se = TRUE)
```

### Retrieve Individual Values

Another way to retrieve polarization estimates for the same set of countries and years is to return only the scalar polarization estimate associated with each country-year. This feature is particularly useful if a user has an imbalanced time series, would prefer to avoid merging data frames, or is working within a ```dplyr``` pipeline:
  
```
data$ideology1 <- apply(data, 1, function(x) get.PolarCAP(countries = x[1], years = x[2], type = "ideology", value.only = TRUE))
data <- rowwise(data) %>% mutate(ideology2 = get.PolarCAP(countries = countries, years = years, type = "ideology", value.only = TRUE))
data
```

### A Note on Country Identifiers

The countries defined above are in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code format. This is the preferred input for ```*.PolarCAP()```. However, these functions will accept country names in almost any language or format and attempt to convert them to ISO3 codes by calling ```to.ISO3()```. ```*.PolarCAP()``` will alert the user to any country names still unrecognized after this conversion and return results only for those which are recognized. In addition, country codes are case-insensitive. Thus, the following all return the same output:
  
```
get.PolarCAP(countries = c("AUS", "MEX", "USA"), years = 2019, type = "ideology")
get.PolarCAP(countries = c("aus", "MEX", "united states"), years = 2019, type = "ideology")
get.PolarCAP(countries = c("aus", "MEX", "Stati Uniti"), years = 2019, type = "ideology")
```
